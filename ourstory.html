            ARCspace is a division of Sustainable Building Council, Ltd., 
            and both are centrally headquartered in the Downtown Los Angeles 
            Cleantech Corridor. We have additional operations in Mexico City. 
            Sustainable Building Council brings together construction experts, 
            architectural designers, engineers, builders, environmentalists, 
            and innovative technology companies to sustainably solve the 
            current affordable housing crisis.<br><br>

            ARCspace builds proprietary prefabricated steel modular building
            systems that are spec-built from the ground up using sustainable
            materials and welded with high-grade steel. ARCspace
            collaborates with fellow housing innovators to deliver sustainable
            new solutions including grid-independent power and water,
            impermanent foundations that support relocation, smart 
            home/building technologies, energy-efficient materials, and 
            nature-accommodating elements such as hurricane impact glass 
            and fire-retardant materials. Working with a variety of public and 
            private interests, ARCspace creates efficient, affordable, and 
            cutting-edge solutions to the problems of homelessness, 
            affordable housing and contemporary/ modern sustainable 
            communities built for the post pandemic world.<br><br>
            
            Beyond ARCspace, Sustainable Building Council, Ltd. also does 
            business (DBA) as ARCaid, the division providing modular units 
            for disaster recovery efforts, and ARClife, the division that 
            serves as a sustainable community builder and developer.

                        Hydraloop  has  created  its  own  unique  and  patented  water  treated  technology, which  removes 
                        dirt, soap, and other pollution using a filter, membrane, or chemicals.The system combines five

                        Bioreactor.

                        Being off grid is a significant goal for our project and our purpose. Hydraloop brings us one step 
                        closer to this by creating a product that has water recycling capacity of 1.6 gallons a day. Furthermore, Hydraloop  makes buildings more  sustainable  and contributes towards  LEED  and 
                        BREEAM certification, herewith, increasing their  value. It ensure perfect quality and certified 
                        recycled water to sustainably save on domestic water usage without compromise on quality of 
                        life or personal hygiene.

                The <strong>affordable housing crisis</strong> has reached epidemic proportions.<br><br>

                Labor, materials, and compliance have made construction 
                increasingly expensive, as the need for housing grows. Today, 
                demand far outweighs supply, with a <strong>shortage of 7.2M 
                affordable units</strong> throughout the US (National Low Income Housing 
                Association, 2018).<br><br>

                Our prefab steel building systems are spec-built from the ground 
                up using sustainable and high grade materials specifically 
                manufactured for each project. ARCspace creates innovative 
                rapidly delivered, low- cost steel prefab or modular buildings that 
                can include leading-edge sustainable building technology as well 
                as grid-independent water, power, and waste solution.<br><br>

                Our units are sized similar to shipping containers for efficient, 
                cost-effective transport and to enable infinite configurability - but 
                make no mistake, these are tremendously different from 
                ‘upcycled’ or ‘recycled’ shipping containers that are often 
                contaminated.<br><br>

                New affordable communities are needed across the U.S. We are 
                taking on that challenge. Hurricanes, tornadoes, and fires ravage 
                an already desperate affordable/homeless housing market 
                nationally. When we factor in the astounding increases in building 
                material costs and skilled labor shortages, our unprecedented 
                homeless/affordable housing crisis reaches epidemic proportions. 
                We will help solve the affordable housing crisis by partnering with 
                governments, educational institutions, nonprofits and private 
                sector to build more resilient, sustainable, scalable housing units 
                at less than the industry average in construction time and cost.
